# Few words about me! 

Hi everyone, I'm Dani 😁. I describe myself as a passionate, curious and ambitious of knowledge student that varely can be satisfied by the amount he knows. 🤔🤔

I started learning programming by casualty and enjoyed doing it as a game. Since I knew that it's possible to work as a dev, I'm preparing myself to make a notable difference on interviews 🤓.

I'm interested in Backend programming but doesn't mean I'm not ready for Frontend..

And that's it.
